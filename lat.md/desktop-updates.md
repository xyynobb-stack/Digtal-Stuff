# Desktop Updates

Desktop updates use GitHub releases and expose both a startup upgrade action and a Settings auto-upgrade preference.

The Electron main process configures `electron-updater` against the repository publisher metadata from `electron-builder.yml`, which points at `fathah/hermes-desktop`. [[src/main/app/updater.ts#setupUpdater]] registers update IPC handlers, persists the auto-upgrade preference under Electron `userData`, and applies that preference to `autoUpdater.autoDownload`.

When GitHub reports a newer release, [[src/renderer/src/screens/Layout/Layout.tsx#Layout]] shows an upgrade button in the sidebar footer as soon as the app reaches the main layout. The button downloads the update when needed, shows download progress, and changes into a restart action after the update is ready.

[[src/renderer/src/components/settings/AboutPane.tsx#AboutPane]] (the About & Updates pane of the settings modal) presents the desktop app as its own card, separate from the Hermes Agent engine card — the two update on independent channels. The card shows the app version, the auto-upgrade toggle, and an explicit update action: [[src/renderer/src/components/settings/useSettingsData.ts#useSettingsData]] subscribes to the same `onUpdateAvailable`/`onUpdateDownloadProgress`/`onUpdateDownloaded`/`onUpdateError` events as the footer button and adds a manual `checkDesktopUpdate` (via `checkForUpdates`) plus a `handleDesktopUpdate` that downloads, then restarts via `installUpdate`. When auto-upgrade is enabled the startup release check downloads automatically; when disabled, downloading waits for the user's click (footer button or this card's action).

## Stable and beta release channels

Two GitHub Actions workflows publish builds; only the stable channel reaches end users' auto-update, so a beta can be tested without risking their devices.

`release.yml` (stable) runs on a push to the `release` branch: it tags `v<version>` from `package.json`, builds all platforms, and publishes a normal GitHub Release carrying the `latest*.yml` update feed. `beta-release.yml` runs on a push to `beta` (or manual dispatch): it stamps a prerelease version `v<version>-beta.<run>` via `scripts/set-version.mjs`, builds the same signed/notarized artifacts, and publishes a **GitHub prerelease** carrying a `beta*.yml` feed.

The isolation is structural: the updater ([[src/main/app/updater.ts#setupUpdater]]) leaves `allowPrerelease` off, so electron-updater's GitHub provider only ever resolves the latest **non-prerelease** release's `latest.yml`. A beta prerelease is therefore invisible to stable clients — testers download the beta installer manually from the prerelease. The beta workflow skips winget + the landing-page rebuild and uses a separate `beta-release` concurrency group so it never cancels a stable release. Cutting a beta for the *next* version requires bumping `package.json` first (a beta of an already-released version sorts lower than its stable tag).
